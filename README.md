## Description

Project SpellFaire is inspired by the trading card game, Magic The Gathering made by Wizards Of The Coast. This application is aimed to help experienced Magic players improve upon their deck power by simulating a deck before they buy/make changes to it. It is a method known as the Goldfisher. The website user is meants to be able to create a deck and store it in a databse, which will be assisted by a signup/login system. 

Once logged in, the user is meant to be able to access their saved decklist as well as modify it as pleased. Not only will there be a search system with card images being displayed, but their will be more information available once each card is searched, including mana cost, oracle text and card's set. All of these informations will be accessed and displayed on the website through Scryfall API. 

Once the deck is built, a simulated mulligan session will be available for the player to playtest. The cards in the deck will be randomized and 7 cards will be available for the player to draw from per turn. However, there will be no rules enforced from the MTG game on the website and the user is expected to know how the game is played prior to mulligan.  

## App details

App is made based on Presenter-View-Model system and all custom components are built to follow the flow. There are several nested components, that represent different parts of the app, for example there is different presenters for search, deck, selected card and mulligan. 

Since the app is for advanced MtG players, there is no explanations about what mulligan is and what kind of cards there can be. But in case it's needed, mulligan is the first part of any MtG game, where each player draws their starting hand that consists of seven random cards. Mulligan simulation helps user to see if their deck is fairly balanced and most of the 'mulligans' are good.  

Almost all elements of the app are responsive to the screen size and are using both CSS and vuetify methods to accomplish that. So the app can be used on different devices, but some of the functionality may lack on sensor screens. We were trying to also use simple colour scheme and modern design to not overwhelm the user and make it easier to use.  

We implemented all basic functions that make the app a working product. Although, there can be a lot of more functionality to this app, but unfortunately we didn't had time to implement all of our ideas before the deadline.
